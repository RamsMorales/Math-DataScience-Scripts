This respository is a compilation of projects and homework assignments I have done for various classes. Most of the implementations will be in python. 

The primary goal of this repository is to show employers that I have experience and/or familiarity with the concepts which I claim to know. I do not claim perfect understanding of all the topics, but I know enough to know which resources to look at to learn more about the problems that may come up related to these subject areas.

Further, this provides me a chance to practice using git for development. 

Bear with me here, I am still learning. Many mistakes may be made. 

I appreciate constructive feedback because I care about learning and improving.

Thank you.
